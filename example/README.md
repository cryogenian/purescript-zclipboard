This example can be build by running the following command in the project root:

```
npm run build-example
```

Viewing the example might not work unless it is hosted on a webserver (something like [`serve`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) should do the trick), due to the use of Flash in `zeroclipboard` and the local security sandboxing model involved.
